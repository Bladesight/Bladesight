# What is extreme STEM?

Extreme STEM is where I use habit stacking to practice a variety of traits I want to improve at. 

Here are the rules:

1.  Each extreme STEM exercise consists of performing physical exercise and solving a Project Euler problem.
2.  I start with reading the Project Euler problem and ensuring I understand it. This must not exceed 10 minutes.
3.  I go for a ~5 km. During the run, I think about the problem and how I would solve it.
4.  After the jog, I immediately sit behind my laptop. I have 60 minutes to do the following:

    1.  Implement the simplest possible solution in Python.
    2.  Generate a GIF that is somehow related to the problem.
    3.  Implement the solution in Rust.
    4.  Write a blog post on docs.bladesight.com that explains the problem and the solution.
    5.  Publish it.
    6.  If there's time left, I'll try to implement a more optimized solution.

5.  I then have 30 minutes to implement the "model answer" provided by Project Euler.
6.  I am not allowed to use Copilot or any other AI to generate code.
7.  I am allowed to pause my timer while working if something pops up. Most likely my kids.
8.  I am allowed to use the internet to look up syntax and documentation.
9.  I am not allowed to look up the solution to the problem before the simple solution is published.
