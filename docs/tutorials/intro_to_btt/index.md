# Welcome to an Introduction To Blade Tip Timing with Python
If you've ever attempted to understand the fundamentals of Blade Tip Timing (BTT), you might have encountered a substantial level of frustration, much like my own experience. This frustration often arises from scholarly journal articles presenting a plethora of equations, statements, and outcomes in a seemingly straightforward manner (I'm equally culpable here :shushing_face:). This can create the false impression that implementing BTT is a straightforward task, when in reality, it's quite the opposite.

I believe that anyone can quickly acquire expertise in BTT. All they need is reproducible code accompanied by clear explanations to begin their journey.

That's the reason I've put together this tutorial. This guide is for graduate students, professors, and professionals who want to begin exploring BTT using Python :simple-python:.

BTT is often described as the ultimate tool for rotor blade vibration measurement. Almost every research paper highlights its growing importance. Even though I agree, I also believe that BTT is still in its infancy. 

I hope this tutorial will contribute in a small way to increasing its adoption.
